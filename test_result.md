# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# CURRENT REQUEST (2026-09-24, supersedes historical scopes below):
# FINAL FOLLOW-UP: iteration_12 frontend all PASS; final backend suites11/11 PASS.
# Manual cover quality control published16 of17 generated (one obscured-face portrait
# quarantined, original retained). Four local no-AI cleanups published. Total412/437,
# missing25. Batch56ba... stopped on explicit Budget has been exceeded. No new AI
# calls after budget, no automatic retry. Details test_reports/iteration_12_followup.md.
# Functional working=true, needs_retesting=false; remaining covers BLOCKED on credit.
# User: "Copertine Mancanti: Genera le 41 copertine che ancora mancano con lo stesso stile cinematografico quando ricarichi il credito. Anteprima Rapida: Mostra la card successiva già leggermente ingrandita mentre trascini, per un cambio più fluido". Confirmed proceed.
# frontend task: Incoming card anticipatory zoom/opacity. implemented=true,
# working=NA, needs_retesting=true. home-story-deck.tsx StoryLayer now uses live
# offset/direction + progress*(1-progress), scaleX max1.012, scaleY/opacity
# boosted ahead of existing linear interpolation. Exact rest/commit geometry,
# no anticipation on idle nudge, reduced-motion disables additional effect.
# Test real held drags 25%/50%, reverse/cancel, complete forward/back, boundaries,
# no accidental reader opening, tap still opens, no loop, filters, narrow viewport.
# Existing dragged flag must not regress. Screenshot smoke /discover390x844 PASS.
# backend task: Authorized one-off remaining-cover batch, existing generator
# unchanged; --limit41 --concurrency1 (no in-flight concurrent charges after stop).
# Log /tmp/pause-cover-batch-current.log; newest memory/cover_batches report.
# Generation may still run during tests. Do NOT invoke any additional AI call.
# Dry-run initially41; compare existing396 refs against NEW report only.
# Inspect status/budget stop, verify completed new hero/thumb images and sources.
# TTS/Stripe intentionally disabled. No auth (documented test_credentials.md).
# testing focus: gesture preview first, then read-only batch validation.
# agent_communication main: report issues precisely; no tests against old baseline179/373.

# Current cover-generation task (supersedes the older UI entries below):
# CURRENT 2026-09-24 batch: user explicitly authorized ALL missing covers at WebP84,
# same existing model/style, preserve pre-existing373. Pilot3 + main20 = 23 new covers.
# Provider returned explicit Budget has been exceeded; main batch stopped safely,
# 41 still missing, NO further AI generation authorized during verification.
# Current reports ONLY: memory/cover_batches/5c7da1546ce245039d51fb4f8d4adbc2.json
# (baseline373, pilot3), 7dbe6ded62644d7e9ccf42931de7f6d0.json (baseline376, new20).
# Needs testing: 46 new media hero/thumb endpoints decode WebP896x1200/448x600;
# source files <=1200 Q84; existing373 refs preserved; counts396/437; dry-run41;
# lock + budget stop; no extra AI process; no API mocks, no auth.
# media_opt pass-through fix: check WebP format BEFORE exif_transpose, preserving
# identical hero bytes rather than recompressing. Check needed resize/EXIF still works.
# Two NEW covers retouched locally (zero AI calls) and report updated: embarrassment
# lettering removed, driving-side cover black footer rectangle blended away.
# New sources retained as .webp directly; Q84 rather than accumulating large PNGs.
# Preview smoke already passed: onboarding390x844 + new whale reader actual hero.
# Frontend, TTS/Stripe unchanged. Old regression tests refer to historical PNG sources
# converted to WebP in previous session; scope baseline for THIS task is373, not179.
# User: "Una volta terminato, genera quante più copertine puoi con stessa qualità di quelle già esistenti, ho ricaricato la chiave api"
# Confirmed: use available API credit for missing covers, preserve existing covers, TTS/Stripe off.
# backend implemented / needs_retesting: generate_covers.py checkpointed batch, source originals
# retained in covers/, same Nano Banana model, atomic no-overwrite DB writes, 3 portrait pilot
# covers (volcanoes-basics, why-seasons, how-glaciers-move), remaining batch currently running.
# Before: 437 stories, 132 generated covers + 47 photographic covers, 258 missing.
# Run reports: memory/cover_batches/*.json (existing_covers snapshot, generated, errors, status).
# Added optional_services.py API guard: TTS defaults off independently of image key; Stripe
# already has no key and returns 503. No auth, frontend edits or runtime image generation.
# Test focus: all completed new hero/thumb endpoints decode; existing 179 covers unchanged;
# run --dry-run does not spend credits; lock prevents duplicate execution; portrait quality;
# preview intro -> Home, new cover reader + scroll, old cover still visible; no TTS calls.
# Screenshot smoke: 390x844 intro loaded; pilot images 896x1200 match existing originals.
# No APIs mocked. Do not invoke real image generation during testing; inspect dry-run only.
# FINAL: 194 new covers published; 373/437 covered; 64 missing. Budget stop honored.
# Final pytest: 5/5 PASS, test_reports/pytest/cover_batch_final.xml. 388 new media
# endpoints verified. All original179 preserved. Recovery (4 already-paid originals)
# idempotent, no AI calls. Seed fallback overwrite fixed; TTS/Stripe intentionally off.
# iteration_5 follow-up: test_reports/cover_batch_followup.md explains corrected test
# baseline/process false positives. No unresolved scoped functional bugs.
